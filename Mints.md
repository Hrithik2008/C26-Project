#### Mints are a delicious treat. They are sweet, cool, and refreshing. There are lots of different ways of making mints, from hard peppermint candies to the soft, crumbly mints often found at weddings and graduation parties. They are easy to make and even more delicious to eat! Not only do they make a great treat for parties, but they also make wonderful gifts!
